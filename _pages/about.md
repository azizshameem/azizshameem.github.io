This website is under construction. I have been wanting to shift the contents from my old website to this one for sometime now...   

Hello ! Hope you are doing well !  
Im Aziz, a data science enthusiast with a keen interest in Machine Learning.  

I currently study at IIT Bombay, though I hail from Pune, where I have attended my secondary and high school. I can speak English and Hindi(and Urdu, somewhat) fluently.

Here are some things that I have pursued as a hobby more or less, and am fascinated by: 
* Tennis
* Chess
* Cricket
* Guitar
* Drums

In my free time, I:
* Like to go through the recent developements in Artifical Intelligence and Machine Learning
* Surf youtube for random tutorials on things I find interesting
* Have in depth conversations about life and its aspects : things that matter
* Watch light-hearted to dark comedy
* Hang out with friends

I am inclined towards calm and meaningful music, usually those associated with some events in my past. I like the nostalgia it brings with it.
I donâ€™t consider having a favorite artist/band, but I usually end up listening to old hindi songs, or ones that resonate with me.
